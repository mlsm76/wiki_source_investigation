# wiki_source_investigation

This is a repo for a dataset of Wikipedias Citations on a page concerning China. It was posted initially on Reddit r/GenZedong and I made two small edits:
1. One instance of "Funded by government" was replaced with "Government funded" in the 'citation_comment' column
2. Also in the citation_comment column, all blanks were replaced with 'No known association', to help get a better idea of the scope for analysis.
